Once there was a crow who was thirsty. He searched for water everywhere. At last he was a water pot near a well.
He looked inside the pot. There as very little water in the pot.The crow saw some stones nearby. He thought of a plan.He picked up 
some stones. He put them one by one into the pot. The water level in the pot came up. The crow drank the water and flew happily
